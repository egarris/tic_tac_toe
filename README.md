# Tic-Tac-Toe

--------------

This is the 1st project I completed as part of JetBrains Academy's Python Developer track.

The program prints an empty 3x3 tic-tac-toe grid, asks a player to enter the coordinates of his or her next move (row 1, column 1 at top left), validates the move and analyzes gameplay. The game ends when one player wins.

This project gave me a much better grasp of Python's syntax and control flow. I also appreciated the emphasis JetBrains placed on PEP 8 styling. This project helped me understand that my code can usually be more concise and readable. Going forward, I would like to focus on finding the sweet spot between code readability and concision.

Topics covered include:
- Code style
- Control flow statements
- Errors and exceptions
- Built-ins
- GitHub
- IDE
